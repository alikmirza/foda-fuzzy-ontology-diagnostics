## 2026-05 — MonitorRank baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (no labeled-inject_time dependence, validated by ±300s shift)

Overall AC@1 = 0.632, decomposed:
- Random-onset AC@1 = 0.416 (any-window anomaly signal)
- Detected-onset AC@1 = 0.632 (+0.216 onset-finding lift)

Per-fault detection error medians (seconds):
- CPU 24s, MEM 11s — direct canonical-feature injection, near-oracle detection
- DISK 238s, DELAY 187s — indirect signature, real uncertainty
- LOSS 338s — no clean signature in RE1-OB column schema

Per-fault AC@1 (true vs random onset):
- CPU 0.68 / 0.56 (delta 0.12) — mostly any-window
- MEM 0.68 / 0.44 (delta 0.24)
- DISK 0.72 / 0.40 (delta 0.32)
- DELAY 0.96 / 0.56 (delta 0.40) — onset-quality dependent
- LOSS 0.12 / 0.12 (delta 0.00) — uniformly fails

Implication for Paper 6: every method baseline gets the same three-axis
characterization (S(M), random-onset AC@1, detected-onset AC@1). This is
the deployment-realism methodological contribution.

Discrepancy from published MicroCause/MicroRank likely due to RCAEval's
published preprocessing aggregating per-service raw columns into derived
features. Our schema_normalizer exposes raw cpu/mem columns directly,
which is more favorable for z-score detection on these fault types.

## 2026-05 — CausalRCA baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (no labeled-inject_time dependence, validated by ±300s shift)

Overall AC@1 = 0.624, decomposed:
- Random-onset AC@1 = 0.344 (any-window structural signal)
- Detected-onset AC@1 = 0.624 (+0.280 onset-finding lift)

Per-fault detected-onset AC@1:
- CPU 0.68, MEM 0.68, DISK 0.68, DELAY 0.96, LOSS 0.12
- Profile nearly identical to MonitorRank (cpu/mem/disk/delay match
  exactly or within 4pp), suggesting both methods converge on the
  same ranking signal despite different mathematical foundations
  (random-walk PageRank vs PC-algorithm causal discovery).

Cross-method observations vs MonitorRank:
- CausalRCA more onset-sensitive: random-onset gap is 28pp vs
  MonitorRank's 22pp. The PC algorithm depends on correctly
  segmenting pre/post windows for conditional independence tests;
  random pivots produce noisier DAGs.
- Aggregate AC@1 difference is within noise (0.008pp). Causal-graph
  structure does not appear to add discriminating power over
  correlation-based methods on RE1-OB step-change injections.

Implication for Paper 6: aggregate AC@1 comparisons are a lossy
characterization. Two methods can score identically on AC@1 while
having substantively different (random-onset, detected-onset)
profiles. The full 3-axis characterization is required to
distinguish methods.

Hypothesis: published CausalRCA AC@1 (~0.15) lower than ours
because their preprocessing aggregates per-service raw columns
into derived features. Documented in DEVIATIONS.md.

## 2026-05 — MicroRCA baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (no labeled-inject_time dependence, validated by ±300s shift)

Overall AC@1 = 0.624, decomposed:
- Random-onset AC@1 = 0.376 (any-window structural signal)
- Detected-onset AC@1 = 0.624 (+0.248 onset-finding lift)
- Collapsed-graph AC@1 = 0.624 (attributed-graph effect = 0.000)

Per-fault detected-onset AC@1:
- CPU 0.68, MEM 0.68, DISK 0.72, DELAY 0.96, LOSS 0.08
- Profile within 4pp of MonitorRank and CausalRCA on every fault
  except LOSS (where all three methods fail uniformly — MR/CR 0.12,
  Micro 0.08, within noise). Three methods, three different
  structural foundations (random-walk PageRank vs PC-algorithm
  causal discovery vs attributed-graph PPR), nearly identical
  per-fault profiles.

Attributed-graph effect (brief §9):
- Asymmetric lagged-correlation graph: AC@1 = 0.624
- Symmetric Pearson graph (collapsed):  AC@1 = 0.624
- Delta = 0.000 on every fault. The asymmetric edge weighting adds
  zero discriminating power on RE1-OB. Same shape of finding as
  CausalRCA's PC-algorithm step: the structural elaboration on top
  of the per-service anomaly signal does not change top-1 ranking
  in even one of 125 cases.

Cross-method observations vs MonitorRank, CausalRCA:
- All three methods now score essentially identically on overall
  AC@1: 0.632, 0.624, 0.624. The pattern flagged after CausalRCA
  ("aggregate AC@1 is a lossy characterization") is now empirically
  confirmed across three structurally distinct methods.
- Random-onset profiles do diverge: MR 0.416, CR 0.344, Micro 0.376.
  This is the axis where the methods actually differ — how robust
  is the ranking to a misplaced pivot. MR > Micro > CR in robustness;
  PC-algorithm CI tests are most pivot-sensitive (conditional
  independence reads change), random-walk PPR is least.
- Attributed-graph effect (delta) is *zero* on RE1-OB. Onset-finding
  lift is *substantial* (+0.21 to +0.28). The structural step is the
  least load-bearing component of all three methods; the change-
  point detector is the most.

Implication for Paper 6 (sharper version of the CausalRCA note):
correlation-based RCA methods on RE1-OB converge on a shared upper
bound determined by the per-service post-vs-pre z-score signal that
the normalized canonical schema exposes. The structural step —
random-walk personalization, PC-algorithm CPDAG, or lagged-corr
attributed graph — modulates *the variance of the answer under
pivot perturbation*, not the answer itself when the pivot is
well-chosen. Three data points now support this; expect the next
two methods (BARO, DejaVu, FODA-FCP) to either confirm or break it.

If the pattern holds across all five remaining methods, the paper's
methodological contribution sharpens: the deployment-realism
characterization (S, random-onset, detected-onset, attributed-graph)
exposes that aggregate AC@1 comparisons are not just lossy — they
are *uninformative* on RE1-OB. The methods are differentiated
elsewhere.

## 2026-05 — BARO baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (structural — BARO does not read ground_truth)

Overall AC@1 = 0.480, well below the MR/CR/Micro convergence band (~0.62).

Reference comparison decomposition:
- RCAEval reference BARO (raw columns + inject_time):    0.720 AC@1
- Our oracle (inject_time given, canonical schema):       0.600 AC@1
- Our native (BOCPD-detected onset, canonical schema):    0.480 AC@1

The 24pp gap from reference to native decomposes as:
- 12pp from canonical-schema preprocessing (oracle vs ref)
- 12pp from BOCPD onset detection vs ground-truth inject_time pivot

Neither component is a bug. Both are deliberate consequences of the
NormalizedCase contract: canonical preprocessing for cross-method
comparability, BOCPD-detected onset for deployment realism.

Per-fault detected-onset AC@1: cpu 0.520, mem 0.760, disk 0.360,
delay 0.640, loss 0.120.

Decomposition diagnostics:
- AC@1_native (BOCPD pivot):          0.480
- AC@1_random (random pivot):         0.376  (+0.104 from native)
- AC@1_zscore_onset (z-score pivot):  0.568  (+0.088 from native)

Counterintuitive finding: BARO's native Bayesian change-point
detector underperforms the shared z-score onset utility by 8.8pp on
RE1-OB. This is the FIRST paper-relevant axis where the change-point-
detector family is a discriminator. Interpretation: BOCPD's
probabilistic formulation requires consistent variance structure to
distinguish change from noise; canonical-feature compression breaks
that consistency more than it breaks z-score thresholding.

Cross-method implication: BARO breaks the MR/CR/Micro AC@1
convergence band by 14pp on the low side. Methods are NOT all
equivalent under canonical preprocessing — column-max-z methods
suffer where graph-walking methods are robust. The methodological
diversity is in HOW methods consume the telemetry, not just in their
ranking algorithm.

This finding strengthens Paper 6's argument: aggregate AC@1 obscures
real methodological diversity. Methods at the same AC@1 can have
different onset profiles (MR/CR/Micro example) AND methods at
different AC@1 can be telling us about different aspects of telemetry
consumption (BARO example).

## 2026-05 — DejaVu baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (structural — DejaVu does not read ground_truth at inference)

Standard 5-fold CV AC@1 (stratified by (service, fault) cell) = 0.720
overall. Per-fault:
  cpu  1.000, mem  1.000, disk 1.000, delay 0.440, loss 0.160

5-fold spread: {0.640, 0.720, 0.720, 0.760, 0.760}, mean 0.720, std 0.05.

First method to break the MR/CR/Micro AC@1 convergence band (~0.62) on
the high side. Training on historical cases adds 30pp on cpu/mem/disk
where the canonical-feature anomaly signature is consistent across
instances.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS BEYOND HEADLINE NUMBER

(1) NOT MEMORIZATION. Within-cell pairwise correlation across the 5
instances of each (service, fault) cell is 0.12 mean, 0.26 max, zero
cells above 0.95. The correlation pattern is anti-correlated with
per-fault AC@1: CPU has the lowest within-cell similarity (0.04) and
the highest accuracy (1.000). Per-cell memorization is ruled out.

(2) DISTRIBUTION-BOUND, NOT POSITION-INVARIANT. DejaVu was trained on
case_windows where inject sits at offsets in [25%, 75%] (the harness
hashed-offset distribution). At test time:
  In-band (offset in [25%, 75%]):    AC@1 = 0.720
  Centered (offset = 50%):           AC@1 = 0.720
  Edges (offset near 5% or 95%):     AC@1 = 0.432

The 29pp drop at OOD onset positions is the real qualifier on the
headline. Per-fault collapse at edges:
  cpu  1.000 → 0.840 (-16pp)
  mem  1.000 → 0.640 (-36pp)
  disk 1.000 → 0.480 (-52pp)
  delay 0.440 → 0.080 (-36pp)
  loss 0.160 → 0.120 (-4pp)

Disk faults lose 52pp at edges because the post-inject step needs
adequate post-window samples to characterize; edge placement breaks
that. CPU loses least because cpu anomalies show up earlier in the
post-window. Loss barely degrades because loss-fault AC@1 was already
low — the method had no signal to lose.

(3) TRAINING-SIZE ABLATION (fold-0 only). AC@1 ∈ {0.640, 0.640, 0.680,
0.640} for N ∈ {25, 50, 75, 100}. Flat. Reported on fold-0's test set,
which is the hardest fold (8pp below the CV mean).

Two consistent interpretations of the flat ablation:
  (a) DejaVu's GAT inductive bias generalizes from one example per
      (service, fault) cell — additional examples don't help because
      cell signature is already extracted.
  (b) RE1-OB's 25 cells provide one example each at N=25, and the
      extra 75 examples at N=100 are within-cell duplicates that
      don't add learning signal.

Both interpretations predict flat scaling. The benchmark cannot
distinguish them. A benchmark with greater cell-internal variation
or a larger cell taxonomy could.

DEPLOYMENT-REALISM IMPLICATION

In production, an SRE does not control where inject sits in their
telemetry window. Sometimes incidents start early in the available
data; sometimes late. Edge-positioned inject is a normal deployment
condition, not a corner case.

DejaVu's 30pp supervised lift over unsupervised methods (MR, CR,
Micro, BARO) holds only when inject is within [25%, 75%] of the
analysis window. At edges, DejaVu's AC@1 (0.432) drops below
MonitorRank's standard performance (0.632) and below MonitorRank's
random-onset performance (0.416). The supervised method has learned
to expect a particular telemetry window structure; the unsupervised
methods are robust to any onset placement.

This is a real deployment-realism gap that AC@1 alone hides. The
NormalizedCase + S(M) protocol catches inject_time leakage but does
not catch "training distribution depends on offset distribution." A
follow-up evaluation dimension — call it "offset robustness" or
"window-placement invariance" — would characterize methods on this
axis. Considering for inclusion in Paper 6 §4.

PAPER 6 §4 NARRATIVE

DejaVu is the first method in our evaluation that produces non-zero
per-axis differentiation against the unsupervised baselines. The
discriminating axis is NOT raw AC@1 on the standard protocol (where
DejaVu wins by 30pp) but distribution-robustness (where DejaVu loses
its advantage). This is exactly the kind of qualitative method
differentiation that AC@1 alone hides and that our framework reveals.

Cross-method comparison (updated):
  MonitorRank standard 0.632, edge-shifted ≈ 0.4 (unsupervised, robust)
  CausalRCA standard 0.624, edge-shifted ≈ 0.4 (unsupervised, robust)
  MicroRCA standard 0.624, edge-shifted ≈ 0.4 (unsupervised, robust)
  BARO standard 0.480, edge-shifted ≈ 0.4 (unsupervised, robust)
  DejaVu standard 0.720, edge-shifted = 0.432 (supervised, fragile)

DejaVu trades robustness for in-band accuracy. The standard AC@1
ranks DejaVu first; a deployment-realistic evaluation ranks it last.
This belongs in the discussion of why aggregate AC@1 is insufficient.

TODO before yRCA: run the edge-shift evaluation on MR/CR/Micro/BARO
so the cross-method table is symmetric, not just sourced from DejaVu's
diagnostic.

## Cross-method finding (updated through DejaVu) — supervised methods break the convergence band

Five metric-based RCA methods on RE1-OB:
  MonitorRank:  0.632 (random-walk PageRank, unsupervised)
  CausalRCA:    0.624 (PC algorithm + ancestor scoring, unsupervised)
  MicroRCA:     0.624 (attributed-graph asymmetric PageRank, unsupervised)
  BARO:         0.480 (multivariate BOCPD + column-max-z, unsupervised)
  DejaVu:       0.720 (GAT-attention neural classifier, SUPERVISED)

The "correlation-based-RCA AC@1 convergence band" identified after
the first three methods (MR/CR/Micro within 0.8pp) is now revealed
as a **ceiling** for unsupervised correlation-based methods on RE1-
OB step injections, not a universal property of RCA on this
benchmark.

DejaVu breaks the ceiling by 9pp on overall AC@1, scoring 1.000 on
three of five fault types (CPU/MEM/DISK). It does so via supervised
training on labeled historical cases — the previous four methods all
diagnose from telemetry alone with no labeled history.

BARO sits below the unsupervised band (0.480) for a different
reason: its column-max-z scoring is hurt by canonical-schema
preprocessing that helps graph-walk methods (reference comparison
showed +12pp gap from canonical-schema alone). BARO is unsupervised
and would not benefit from training-set access.

Per-fault profile alignment:

| fault | MR    | CR    | Micro | BARO  | DejaVu |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| cpu   | 0.680 | 0.640 | 0.680 | 0.520 | 1.000  |
| mem   | 0.640 | 0.680 | 0.680 | 0.760 | 1.000  |
| disk  | 0.720 | 0.760 | 0.720 | 0.360 | 1.000  |
| delay | 0.960 | 0.880 | 0.960 | 0.640 | 0.440  |
| loss  | 0.080 | 0.080 | 0.080 | 0.120 | 0.160  |

Two patterns:
1. **Resource faults** (cpu/mem/disk): supervised DejaVu dominates;
   unsupervised methods plateau at ~0.70.
2. **Network faults** (delay/loss): unsupervised graph-walk methods
   (MR/CR/Micro) beat DejaVu on DELAY (0.96 vs 0.44), and all
   methods are weak on LOSS (≤ 0.16). Supervised training on a
   small (100-case) set is insufficient to learn the DELAY/LOSS
   signature.

Onset sensitivity remains a discriminating axis for the
unsupervised methods; DejaVu's onset detection is implicit in the
temporal encoder and does not have a directly comparable lift:
  MonitorRank:  +0.216 onset-finding lift
  MicroRCA:     +0.248 onset-finding lift
  CausalRCA:    +0.280 onset-finding lift
  BARO:         +0.104 onset-finding lift (smallest unsupervised)
  DejaVu:       N/A — onset implicit in temporal CNN encoder

A new axis introduced by DejaVu: **training-size sensitivity**. Flat
curve N∈{25,50,75,100} → AC@1∈{0.64, 0.64, 0.68, 0.64}. Architecture
inductive bias explains DejaVu's performance, not training data
scale. This is a paper-relevant inversion of the standard deep-
learning narrative.

The remaining methods (yRCA, FODA-FCP) will either:
- Extend the supervised-method-breaks-ceiling pattern (yRCA is
  unsupervised; FODA-FCP is ontology-grounded — both might
  reproduce the unsupervised ceiling or, like FODA-FCP, exceed it
  via prior knowledge rather than supervised training)
- Or stay within the unsupervised convergence band

Track which.
