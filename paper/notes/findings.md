## 2026-05 — MonitorRank baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (no labeled-inject_time dependence, validated by ±300s shift)

Overall AC@1 = 0.632, decomposed:
- Random-onset AC@1 = 0.416 (any-window anomaly signal)
- Detected-onset AC@1 = 0.632 (+0.216 onset-finding lift)

Per-fault detection error medians (seconds):
- CPU 24s, MEM 11s — direct canonical-feature injection, near-oracle detection
- DISK 238s, DELAY 187s — indirect signature, real uncertainty
- LOSS 338s — no clean signature in RE1-OB column schema

Per-fault AC@1 (true vs random onset):
- CPU 0.68 / 0.56 (delta 0.12) — mostly any-window
- MEM 0.68 / 0.44 (delta 0.24)
- DISK 0.72 / 0.40 (delta 0.32)
- DELAY 0.96 / 0.56 (delta 0.40) — onset-quality dependent
- LOSS 0.12 / 0.12 (delta 0.00) — uniformly fails

Implication for Paper 6: every method baseline gets the same three-axis
characterization (S(M), random-onset AC@1, detected-onset AC@1). This is
the deployment-realism methodological contribution.

Discrepancy from published MicroCause/MicroRank likely due to RCAEval's
published preprocessing aggregating per-service raw columns into derived
features. Our schema_normalizer exposes raw cpu/mem columns directly,
which is more favorable for z-score detection on these fault types.

## 2026-05 — CausalRCA baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (no labeled-inject_time dependence, validated by ±300s shift)

Overall AC@1 = 0.624, decomposed:
- Random-onset AC@1 = 0.344 (any-window structural signal)
- Detected-onset AC@1 = 0.624 (+0.280 onset-finding lift)

Per-fault detected-onset AC@1:
- CPU 0.68, MEM 0.68, DISK 0.68, DELAY 0.96, LOSS 0.12
- Profile nearly identical to MonitorRank (cpu/mem/disk/delay match
  exactly or within 4pp), suggesting both methods converge on the
  same ranking signal despite different mathematical foundations
  (random-walk PageRank vs PC-algorithm causal discovery).

Cross-method observations vs MonitorRank:
- CausalRCA more onset-sensitive: random-onset gap is 28pp vs
  MonitorRank's 22pp. The PC algorithm depends on correctly
  segmenting pre/post windows for conditional independence tests;
  random pivots produce noisier DAGs.
- Aggregate AC@1 difference is within noise (0.008pp). Causal-graph
  structure does not appear to add discriminating power over
  correlation-based methods on RE1-OB step-change injections.

Implication for Paper 6: aggregate AC@1 comparisons are a lossy
characterization. Two methods can score identically on AC@1 while
having substantively different (random-onset, detected-onset)
profiles. The full 3-axis characterization is required to
distinguish methods.

Hypothesis: published CausalRCA AC@1 (~0.15) lower than ours
because their preprocessing aggregates per-service raw columns
into derived features. Documented in DEVIATIONS.md.

## 2026-05 — MicroRCA baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (no labeled-inject_time dependence, validated by ±300s shift)

Overall AC@1 = 0.624, decomposed:
- Random-onset AC@1 = 0.376 (any-window structural signal)
- Detected-onset AC@1 = 0.624 (+0.248 onset-finding lift)
- Collapsed-graph AC@1 = 0.624 (attributed-graph effect = 0.000)

Per-fault detected-onset AC@1:
- CPU 0.68, MEM 0.68, DISK 0.72, DELAY 0.96, LOSS 0.08
- Profile within 4pp of MonitorRank and CausalRCA on every fault
  except LOSS (where all three methods fail uniformly — MR/CR 0.12,
  Micro 0.08, within noise). Three methods, three different
  structural foundations (random-walk PageRank vs PC-algorithm
  causal discovery vs attributed-graph PPR), nearly identical
  per-fault profiles.

Attributed-graph effect (brief §9):
- Asymmetric lagged-correlation graph: AC@1 = 0.624
- Symmetric Pearson graph (collapsed):  AC@1 = 0.624
- Delta = 0.000 on every fault. The asymmetric edge weighting adds
  zero discriminating power on RE1-OB. Same shape of finding as
  CausalRCA's PC-algorithm step: the structural elaboration on top
  of the per-service anomaly signal does not change top-1 ranking
  in even one of 125 cases.

Cross-method observations vs MonitorRank, CausalRCA:
- All three methods now score essentially identically on overall
  AC@1: 0.632, 0.624, 0.624. The pattern flagged after CausalRCA
  ("aggregate AC@1 is a lossy characterization") is now empirically
  confirmed across three structurally distinct methods.
- Random-onset profiles do diverge: MR 0.416, CR 0.344, Micro 0.376.
  This is the axis where the methods actually differ — how robust
  is the ranking to a misplaced pivot. MR > Micro > CR in robustness;
  PC-algorithm CI tests are most pivot-sensitive (conditional
  independence reads change), random-walk PPR is least.
- Attributed-graph effect (delta) is *zero* on RE1-OB. Onset-finding
  lift is *substantial* (+0.21 to +0.28). The structural step is the
  least load-bearing component of all three methods; the change-
  point detector is the most.

Implication for Paper 6 (sharper version of the CausalRCA note):
correlation-based RCA methods on RE1-OB converge on a shared upper
bound determined by the per-service post-vs-pre z-score signal that
the normalized canonical schema exposes. The structural step —
random-walk personalization, PC-algorithm CPDAG, or lagged-corr
attributed graph — modulates *the variance of the answer under
pivot perturbation*, not the answer itself when the pivot is
well-chosen. Three data points now support this; expect the next
two methods (BARO, DejaVu, FODA-FCP) to either confirm or break it.

If the pattern holds across all five remaining methods, the paper's
methodological contribution sharpens: the deployment-realism
characterization (S, random-onset, detected-onset, attributed-graph)
exposes that aggregate AC@1 comparisons are not just lossy — they
are *uninformative* on RE1-OB. The methods are differentiated
elsewhere.

## Cross-method finding — RCAEval ranking-AC@1 convergence

Three structurally distinct metric-based RCA methods (MonitorRank,
CausalRCA, MicroRCA) achieve essentially identical overall AC@1 on
RE1-OB (0.632, 0.624, 0.624 respectively; spread 0.8pp). Per-fault
profiles also converge within 4pp on cpu/mem/disk/delay and within
4pp on loss.

The convergence persists across mathematically distinct foundations:
random-walk PageRank, PC-algorithm causal discovery, attributed-graph
asymmetric PageRank. All three methods, when given the same
NormalizedCase input, produce the same top-1 ranking in the vast
majority of cases.

The collapsed-graph diagnostic on MicroRCA isolates the cause:
replacing MicroRCA's asymmetric lag-1 correlation graph with a
symmetric uniform-weighted graph produces identical top-1 in 125/125
cases. The attributed-graph structure adds zero discriminating power
on RE1-OB.

Interpretation: on benchmarks where the fault signature is a clean
step-change on directly observable canonical features (cpu, mem,
disk, delay), the per-service anomaly score is sufficient to
identify the root cause. Graph-walking algorithms, regardless of
their structure, all converge to ranking services by their anomaly
score. The graph topology contributes nothing because it does not
need to.

This finding has two implications for Paper 6:

1. AGGREGATE AC@1 IS A WEAK DISCRIMINATOR. The standard ranking
metric used by 90% of microservice RCA papers cannot distinguish
methods that are mathematically very different. New evaluation
dimensions are needed (and Paper 6 proposes four).

2. ONSET SENSITIVITY IS A REAL DISCRIMINATOR. Random-onset
decomposition reveals that the three methods do differ in their
dependence on accurate anomaly onset detection. CausalRCA most
sensitive (+0.280 onset lift), MonitorRank least (+0.216), MicroRCA
intermediate (+0.248). This dimension belongs in any honest
characterization of an RCA method.

The remaining methods (BARO, DejaVu, yRCA, FODA-FCP) will either
extend or break this pattern. Track which ones.
