# Findings

Running log of empirical findings from the Paper-6 experimental work.
Entries are dated and grouped by topic. The point of this file is to
preserve interpretations that informed downstream decisions — the
numbers themselves live in `results/`, this file says what they
*meant* and what we did next.

## 2026-05 — MonitorRank baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (no labeled-inject_time dependence, validated by ±300s shift)

Overall AC@1 = 0.632, decomposed:
- Random-onset AC@1 = 0.416 (any-window anomaly signal)
- Detected-onset AC@1 = 0.632 (+0.216 onset-finding lift)

Per-fault detection error medians (seconds):
- CPU 24s, MEM 11s — direct canonical-feature injection, near-oracle detection
- DISK 238s, DELAY 187s — indirect signature, real uncertainty
- LOSS 338s — no clean signature in RE1-OB column schema

Per-fault AC@1 (true vs random onset):
- CPU 0.68 / 0.56 (delta 0.12) — mostly any-window
- MEM 0.68 / 0.44 (delta 0.24)
- DISK 0.72 / 0.40 (delta 0.32)
- DELAY 0.96 / 0.56 (delta 0.40) — onset-quality dependent
- LOSS 0.12 / 0.12 (delta 0.00) — uniformly fails

Implication for Paper 6: every method baseline gets the same three-axis
characterization (S(M), random-onset AC@1, detected-onset AC@1). This is
the deployment-realism methodological contribution.

Discrepancy from published MicroCause/MicroRank likely due to RCAEval's
published preprocessing aggregating per-service raw columns into derived
features. Our schema_normalizer exposes raw cpu/mem columns directly,
which is more favorable for z-score detection on these fault types.

## 2026-05 — CausalRCA baseline characterization on RE1-OB

S(M) = 0.000 (no labeled-inject_time dependence, validated by ±300s shift)

Overall AC@1 = 0.624, decomposed:
- Random-onset AC@1 = 0.344 (any-window structural signal)
- Detected-onset AC@1 = 0.624 (+0.280 onset-finding lift)

Per-fault detected-onset AC@1:
- CPU 0.68, MEM 0.68, DISK 0.68, DELAY 0.96, LOSS 0.12
- Profile nearly identical to MonitorRank (cpu/mem/disk/delay match
  exactly or within 4pp), suggesting both methods converge on the
  same ranking signal despite different mathematical foundations
  (random-walk PageRank vs PC-algorithm causal discovery).

Cross-method observations vs MonitorRank:
- CausalRCA more onset-sensitive: random-onset gap is 28pp vs
  MonitorRank's 22pp. The PC algorithm depends on correctly
  segmenting pre/post windows for conditional independence tests;
  random pivots produce noisier DAGs.
- Aggregate AC@1 difference is within noise (0.008pp). Causal-graph
  structure does not appear to add discriminating power over
  correlation-based methods on RE1-OB step-change injections.

Implication for Paper 6: aggregate AC@1 comparisons are a lossy
characterization. Two methods can score identically on AC@1 while
having substantively different (random-onset, detected-onset)
profiles. The full 3-axis characterization is required to
distinguish methods.

Hypothesis: published CausalRCA AC@1 (~0.15) lower than ours
because their preprocessing aggregates per-service raw columns
into derived features. Documented in DEVIATIONS.md.
